# Commands prefixed with an exclamation mark (!) will be run in parallel,
# without waiting for them to finish first, but not started until any
# non-parallel commands before them have finished. Thus, in the following
# configuration:
#
# commands = [
#    "!backgroundcmd1",
#    "normalcommand foo bar",
#    "!backgroundcmd2 foo",
#    "!backgroundcmd3 bar"
# ]
#

# as normalcommand has finished, backgroundcmd2 and backgroundcmd3 will be run
# concurrently. When all parallel commands have reported in, shutdown will
# commence
